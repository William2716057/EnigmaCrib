#Complete the code here to output all possible valid cribs using the ciphertext and the plaintext to use for the crib
#You will need to test all posible positions of the crib and discard cribs containing at least one letter encoded as itself.

#iterate through each index of each string if indexes contain the same letter
#shift character in position 0 of plaintext by one padding 
#plaintext with 0 in front
#print results that do not contain matches
